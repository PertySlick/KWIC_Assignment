### Assignment Description
_For a complete description of this assignment please see the [Assignment Description](./AssignmentDescription.md) file in this repository._

The goal of this assignment is to take note of the positive aspect of code modularization.  For part one, I will design a solution to the assignment with only early coding concepts in mind.  This would be an early Java II mentality for others in this program.  The goal is to get the core requested functionality working as quickly as possible.  Part two I will implement a more modern modularized and abstracted design.  This version will consider not only the current requested features and functionality, but also testability and ensuring that later customization or expansion is made easier or even possible.
